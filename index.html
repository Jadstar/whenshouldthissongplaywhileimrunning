            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>Spotify has a bunch of characteristics for each song which can be accessed via their Web API.</p>
                <p>E.g.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Danceability</li>
        <li>Tempo</li>
        <li>Acousticness</li>
        <li>Instrumentalness</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By going through songs and theorising when they should play manually, I can separate these songs into 5 different running stages.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Warmup</li>
        <li>Recovery/ Base Run</li> 
        <li>Tempo Run</li>
        <li>Race Run</li>
        <li>Cool down</li>
        <li>Falloff</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I've learnt that there is a lot of overlap in which songs are viable for the sections, (race and tempo are practically interchangeable, as are recovery and cooldown). So the priority is to maintain the 'momentum' of the run via the songs playing, rather than guarantee that a specific song is only played during an exact stage of running.</p>

    <p>Essentially, it's just about weeding out 'run-destroying' songs in a playlist, and trying to time motivational music when it is needed the most.</p>

    <p>Since I can't test every song in the world, and I have my own personal biases, I made this site so others can agree/disagree with me so I can try and improve this system.</p>

            <h2>but why?</h2>
            <p>I don't like it when im trying to run a PB and somewhere over the rainbow (acoustic version) starts playing</p>
            <p>Sure, a rational person would just make a specialised playlist for running, but what if im having an off day and need rocky theme song to play? I don't want it play every single run I do, but only during the times I need it the most.</p>
